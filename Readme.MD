# Builder Pattern

Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern that facilitates the construction of complex objects step by step. This pattern separates the construction of an object from its representation.

## Explanation

In this project, we have two builders: `MsiBuilder` and `MacBuilder`. These builders are responsible for creating different types of laptops.

The `Director` class calls various methods like `BuildMsiHome()`, `BuildMacbookAir()`, `BuildMsiGaming()`, `BuildMacbookPro()`, and `BuildMacPro()`. Each of these methods instructs the corresponding builder to create a specific laptop.

The `showProduct()` method in the `Builder` class is used to display the specifications of the laptop.

The `GetProduct()` method on the `Builder` class is used to obtain the actual laptop object.

## Benefits of the Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern offers the following advantages:

- Simplifies the code for creating complex objects, making it more readable and maintainable.
- Separates object construction from its representation, making testing easier.
- Allows the creation of different representations of the same object.

## Drawbacks of the Builder Pattern

The Builder Pattern has the following drawbacks:

- It can introduce some complexity into the code.
- Implementing the pattern correctly can be challenging.

## Conclusion

The Builder Pattern is a powerful design pattern for creating complex objects. While it offers numerous benefits, it should be used judiciously to mitigate its drawbacks.
